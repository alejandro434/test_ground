    - analyze: Break down into components
    - think: General reasoning and problem solving
    - read: Extract and understand information
    - judge: Make evaluative decisions
    - interpret: Explain meaning and significance
    - synthesize: Combine multiple elements
    - compare: Identify similarities and differences
    - evaluate: Assess quality or value
